  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
 <p>

  Hello, I am Steven Nguyen. My passion of art came from when I was 8 years old when I
  got my first video game console and I was intrigued by the artistry and scale of the games that I played on and now my passion
  has develop into computer coding and video editing. After taking my Introductory Video Editing class at SJSU, I want to take my love for
  editing video to YouTube which I have a channel on which is called CAPTAIN STEVEO which is still under maintenence. My interest
  in coding came about when my sister, whom is also a web developer, introduced me HTML coding and how to build a website. Since then
  I decided to become a Digital Media Artist major. What I want to accomplish the most is mainly computer programming. I feel coding
  especially web development will take an artist a long way in a career.
