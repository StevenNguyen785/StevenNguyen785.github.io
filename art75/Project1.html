<h1>Project 1: Video Art Artist Statement-
	Abstract art is the main theme of this project and also I am a huge fan of it as well. The way this project was conceived was by watching YouTube videos on abstract art then learn from what I have watched and  then on the Filmic Pro app on my phone which I highly recommend for students who do not have a DSLR camera, I recorded my shots. I did not make an exact reenactment of what I seen on those YouTube videos but I had to improvise myself to create the abstract art that I want. I titled this piece “Intellectual Proximity” as a more formal way of saying “Close Abstract.”
	The reason why I have a passion for Abstract art is because of the uniqueness of it. For example, abstract is not ordinary and we see ordinary things everyday for instance, cars, trees, mailboxes etc... But abstraction, which is the opposite of ordinary, we want to see in everyday life like myself, sometimes we have to create it in art form to see it the way we want to see it. Overall, for the basis of this project is that I want to created the illusion that almost anything can be abstract if we can look more closely at it. </h1>
