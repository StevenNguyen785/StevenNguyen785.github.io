    <h1>Project 2: Video as installation Artist Statement-
	The idea or the theme for this project was without brainstorming at all but the first thing comes t to mind for this installation project was “Does violent video games cause violence to gamers.” To have more of a video gaming type theme for my installation, I added VR components or equipment for this project. The exact equipment I used for this class project was with my Playstation VR, theconsole itself, and a 24 inch monitor. If I showed this piece to an actual art gallery I would have a a 70 inch television with the most updated Oculus Rift device and a powerful PC to go along with it. I have titled this project “DON'T PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON?” because its a metaphor stating how will a person be influenced once they pick up the controller then boot up the violent video game and press the fire button?
	I have chosen the violent video game theme is because once I present this project in class, I want to have everyone's thoughts and feedback to this question, ““Does violent video games cause violence?” which has been a controversial topic in the gaming community for quite sometime.
The feedback from the class is what I wanted to hear which is very mixed. I would like to leave the viewer with the thought “right after” they watch my video installation is that “with the evolution of  how realistic games are now with VR, once violent video games makes it very mainstream for VR in the future like it is right now without it, will it influence violence for gamers even more?”</h1>
