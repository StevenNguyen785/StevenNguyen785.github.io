<h1>Project 3: Critical Interactivity Artist Statement-
	The “Darkweb” I believe is a trap because once you enter that specific cyber-world, anyone can monitor you or track or even a lot worse and that's why I named this project “Darkweb Consequences.” The sub-topics for this HTML/CSS project are hiring a hitman, human trafficing, and the infamous red room which I believe are all the most popular categories within the Darkweb world.  As a very important note, this is “my very first website that I officially built” so as coding rookie, I really want to make my point clearly with this project which is more of an awareness than just entertainment when it comes to the Darkweb.
	From the main page, my friend Jacob came up with the idea to have the icons transparent which was a good idea but the real Critical Interactivity for this project are the four links. All the links sends the viewers to another page which are Youtube videos of me introducing the website and sub-topics and the other videos describes the 3 sub-topics from different YouTubers. The reason why I didn't make videos describing the sub-topics is because the other videos that I have linked I believe are Youtubers whom know more about these categories is because they probably visited the actual Darkweb. <h1>
