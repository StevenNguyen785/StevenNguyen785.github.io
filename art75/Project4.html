<h1>Final Project Artist Statement-
	After learning about Takeshi Murata's “Datamoshing” art video, “Monster Movie” I had to make my final project as a video installation instead of a HTML/CSS or P5 type of project. I've decided to make a compilation video of different genres of Hollywood films for example comedy, horror, romance etc... I used a very handy software program called “Avidemux” to get he datamoshing effects that I needed. My art video displays 2 side to side videos with my non-datamoshing compilation video on the right and the datamoshing version on the left and I will discuss why I have displayed them like this at the end of my second paragraph.
	In my opinion if a person is not familiar or doesn't see the artistry of digital art or datamoshing, once they see a movie or play a video game in datamoshing form the first inclination that they have is “annoyance” because our minds are used to seeing video displays without any type of distortion, so with my project hopefully I can change that perception for the viewers. “What is Datamoshing?” is the title of my piece which refers to anyone or the viewers of whom don't know what datamoshing and once they see my full video compilation video hopefully it will answer their question. The reason why I have one datamosh video and one none side by side is because I want to conduct an experiment to see which video would the class see more interest or focus on and by doing this I had the class check on a sheet a paper which one they preferred. The results in my opinion was kinda surprising because the majority of votes came from the datamoshing video.  <h1>
